 [中文版戳这](README.md)



English is not my mother tongue, please forgive the wrong expression.

This is a maze game developed with godot. This game is still under development. This is just Version 1. This is currently a very boring game with only one level. But in the future, this game will move towards diversified goals.

As for the future, it is not easy to say. but I do have a lot of interesting ideas, hoping to become a reality in the near future.

## How to play

Use keyboard Up, down, left and right control, support Joystick also. Go to the position of the red flag to finish the level. Of course, the effect of customs clearance is to pop up a paragraph of text.

## future development

1. Various maps
2. Organs, triggers, etc. (Development towards adventure games)
3. Mobile support
4. Randomly generate levels
5. For more ideas please mention issue
